This is a guide to the API calls to the NodeJS backend:

# #NOTES
# 1. I am still having issues with connecting the node driver to the remote MongDB Atlas database. 
The Connection keeps closing, so while I work on finding the issue, just re-start the node server and use it during development. It works well enough to build the FE and backend and test the APIs.

# 2. I have not tested all the db queries, so they may not work. Feel free to tweak. 
May need to use Mongoose instead of the mongodb node driver. But we'll see.

# 3 On the apis that I have testes, works fine:
    --signup, login, and  get posts api calls

# 4 For the rest, I am still working on the react FE, so I add and test them as I finish the FE view.
 Currently on the AddPost Component in React.

# 5 shoot me a meesage on Slack if you need any clarification!!
