NOTES:
# 1 Finished the following ( not the prettiest, but works):
   1) Welcome Component
   2) Signup Component
   3) Login Component
   4) Home Component - '/' or '/posts' urls - I used some hardcoded dummy text for some of the Components, but will remove   them once I build the API calls to backend
   5) PostItem Component - the buttons (e.g for showing comments) do not work yet, as I have not built the related components/api calls
# 2 Working on:
   1) AddPost Component (incl. uploading images).
# Remaining work
   1) EditPost (same as AddPost,except just data is prepopulated)
   2) All Comments Components - Add, Delete, reply
   3) All Chats/Messages Components - View List, Send, Reply, Delete
   4) Testing
   5) Misc - Anything that may come up
